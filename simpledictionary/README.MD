# Simple Dictionary - Project 1

[Simple Dictionary](https://simpledictionary.onrender.com/)


This project incorporates data from the Merriam Webster dictionary API. The site will feature a search bar where users can input any word or text. If the user input matches a word in the dictionary, the definition of the word will appear in the display.

The API call is written using the jQuery Ajax method. The input form as well as the results display were built using HTML. Javascript, and jQuery were used to target the user input and receive form data. The visible page elements were styled using CSS. The navigation bar and links were built with HTML and CSS, and the information displayed on those pages is retrieved using jQuery methods.

The approach was simply to succesfully display some data relevant to the app idea on the page and style it in an appropriate way given the idea. The most important aspect of the code that makes this app work is the query feature within the click function which allows any word or query to be subsituted into the API call. Using JavaScript array methods to isolate the desired data, combined with jQuery methods to retrieve the data and incorporate it into the DOM, the app becomes functional.

There is nothing to install for this site to work, the link is sufficient.

The main limitation of this project is that there is a lot of data for each word entry in the dictionary, which made it difficult to giving a complete list of the information on each word in a clear way.
